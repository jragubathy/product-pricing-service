Assumption:

Product Catalog Service :

1) Product Name is Unique
2) User can add only one product at a time
3) Product Type can be same for 'n' number of products


Product Pricing Service :

1) Product Name is Unique and details are retrieved based on it
2) Single product price can be retrieved at a time


Database :

1) Database records are added during application startup for testing purpose
2) Tables are indexed based on product name



Risks :
-----------

Product Catalog Service :

1) No limit on retrieval of products. It leads to performance issues if products grow.


General :

1) Load balancer is not configured for this services. This can be done by using HAProxy/Apache HTTPD
2) Token mechanism has to be introduced to access the services
